# Session 6: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 6 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete 4 coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: 
Create a SwiftUI view with a `Text` component that displays the message `"Welcome to SwiftUI!"`.
Add a Button that prints `"Button tapped"` when pressed.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 2:
Create a SwiftUI view with a `Toggle` that switches between "On" and "Off", and a Text view that displays the current state.
   
Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 3: 
Create a SwiftUI view that arranges three `Text` components in a `VStack`, an `HStack`, and a `ZStack`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 4: 
Create a Text view that says `"Hello, Swift!"`, and apply the following view modifiers:
`.font(.largeTitle)`
`.foregroundColor(.blue)`
`.padding()`
`.background(Color.yellow)`
`.frame(width: 200, height: 100)`

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

## Done?
1. Before logging and saving your changes remotely, you need to specify the changed files you want to save:
   1. To save *all* files in the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   2. To save a specific file/folder from the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add {path to file, exclude the brackets}
   ```
3. While in the same directory, make sure you've logged/committed your changes with the following command.
```bash
git commit -m "{describe what changes you made to the file here}"
```
3. If the previous step was already complete, save your changes to the remote repository as follows.
```bash
git push
```
