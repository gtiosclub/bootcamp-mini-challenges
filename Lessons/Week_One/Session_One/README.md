# Session 1: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 1 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle three short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete three coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: Variables and Constants
1. Declare a variable called `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello, World!"`.
2. Declare a constant called `pi` and assign it the value `3.14159`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 2: Conditionals
Create an if statement that checks if a variable number is greater than 10. If it is, print `"Number is greater than 10"`. If not, print `"Number is 10 or less"`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


### Task 3: Operators
1. Declare two variables `a` and `b` with values 5 and 3 respectively.
2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient, and print each result.
3. With a `guard` statement, check that `a` is great than or equal to 5. Proceed with the program if it is, otherwise run the following block of code -> `fatalError("Exiting program")`
4. With another `guard` statement, check that `a` is great than 4 or `b` is less than 3. Proceed with the program if it is, otherwise run the following block of code -> `fatalError("Exiting program")`

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


## Done?
1. Before logging and saving your changes remotely, you need to specify the changed files you want to save:
   1. To save *all* files in the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   2. To save a specific file/folder from the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add {path to file, exclude the brackets}
   ```
3. While in the same directory, make sure you've logged/committed your changes with the following command.
```bash
git commit -m "{describe what changes you made to the file here}"
```
3. If the previous step was already complete, save your changes to the remote repository as follows.
```bash
git push
```
