# iOS Club - Bootcamp Mini-Challenges

Get ready to test your knowledge with these mini-challenges! We'll be updating this repository every session to introduce more mini-challenges.

## How to Start

**1. Initialize Your Repository**
   - Begin by cloning this repository and creating a new branch from this repository.
   - From terminal `cd` into the directory this repository is held in. 
   - Name the branch after yourself, e.g. `{your first name}_{your last name)` (This step will only have to be done the first time).
   ```bash
   git checkout -b {your first name}_{your last name)
   ```
   - Then, navigate to the session's folder using the `cd` commmand! e.g. Perform the following command to navigate to the week 1, session 1 challenge.
   ```bash
   cd Week_One/Session_One
   ```
   
**2. Start Solving**
   - Once you have completed the above steps, you will see two files. 
     - One will be a file representing the instructions for the mini-challenge.
     - The remaining files will have to do with the actual challenge you have to solve.
  - Start solving!

## Steps for Every Session

For every session, you will not have to complete all the steps required above to get started.
- Mainly, first, use the three commands below to work on your own branch and get the new session's questions/instructions
  ```bash
   git switch {your first name}_{your last name)
   git pull origin/main
   ```
- Then, `cd` to the session's folder and solve!
