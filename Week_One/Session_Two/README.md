# Session 2: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 2 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle three short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete three coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: Understanding nil
1. Declare a variable name of type String (optional) and assign it the value nil.
2. Check if name is nil, and if it is, print "Name is nil".

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 2: Introduction to Optionals
1. Declare an optional Int called age and assign it a value of 25.
2. Print the value of age using optional unwrapping.
   
Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


### Task 3: Force Unwrapping
1. Declare an optional Double called height and assign it a value of 5.8.
2. Force unwrap it and print the value.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 4: Optional Binding
1. Declare an optional String called username and assign it the value "JohnDoe".
2. Use optional binding (if let) to check if username has a value. If it does, print "Username is X" where X is the unwrapped value.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


## Done?
1. Before logging and saving your changes remotely, you need to specify the changed files you want to save:
   1. To save *all* files in the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   2. To save a specific file/folder from the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add {path to file, exclude the brackets}
   ```
3. While in the same directory, make sure you've logged/committed your changes with the following command.
```bash
git commit -m "{describe what changes you made to the file here}"
```
3. If the previous step was already complete, save your changes to the remote repository as follows.
```bash
git push
```
