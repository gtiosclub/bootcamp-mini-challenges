# Session 1: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 1 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle three short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete three coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: Variables and Constants
1. Declare a variable called `greeting` and assign it the value `"Hello, World!"`.
2. Declare a constant called `pi` and assign it the value `3.14159`.

### Task 2: Conditionals
Create an if statement that checks if a variable number is greater than 10. If it is, print `"Number is greater than 10"`. If not, print `"Number is 10 or less"`.

### Task 3: Operators
Declare two variables `a` and `b` with values 5 and 3 respectively.
Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient, and print each result.
