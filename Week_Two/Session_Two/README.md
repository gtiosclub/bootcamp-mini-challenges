# Session 4: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 4 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: Defining and Using a Simple Closure
Define a closure that takes two integers and returns their sum.
Use the closure to calculate the sum of 3 and 5.

### Task 2: Using Closures with .sorted()
Given an array of integers numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 7], use a closure with the .sorted() function to sort the array in descending order.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 3: 
Use a closure with the .filter() function to filter out even numbers from the array numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Then, use a closure with the .map() function to square each of the remaining numbers.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 4: 
Use the trailing closure syntax to define a closure that prints "Hello, World!" inside a function.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 5: 
Create a closure that captures an external variable and increments it by 1 each time the closure is called.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


## Done?
1. Before logging and saving your changes remotely, you need to specify the changed files you want to save:
   1. To save *all* files in the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   2. To save a specific file/folder from the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add {path to file, exclude the brackets}
   ```
3. While in the same directory, make sure you've logged/committed your changes with the following command.
```bash
git commit -m "{describe what changes you made to the file here}"
```
3. If the previous step was already complete, save your changes to the remote repository as follows.
```bash
git push
```
