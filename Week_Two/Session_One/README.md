# Session 3: Coding Mini-Challenge

Welcome to session 3 of bootcamp! Today, you'll tackle short coding questions designed to test your understanding of basic concepts. Let's dive in!

## Challenge Overview

In this session, you'll complete coding questions, each designed to reinforce key programming concepts. Be sure to read the instructions carefully and feel free to ask your instructor if you have any questions!

### Task 1: 
1. Create an `array` of integers called numbers with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2. Add the number `6` to the array and print the updated array.
3. Remove the first element and print the updated array.

Make sure to sta your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 2:
1. Create a `dictionary` with keys as `student names` and values as their `grades`: ["John": 90, "Jane": 85, "Jake": 88].
2. Add a new student `Jim` with a grade of `92`.
3. Print the grade of `Jane`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 3: 
1. Create a `set` of numbers called `uniqueNumbers` with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
2. Add the number 5 to the `set` and observe what happens.
3. Print the `set`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 4: 
1. Create an `array of strings` called `fruits` with the values ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"].
2. Use a for loop to print each `fruit` in the `array`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 5: 
1.  Use a `while` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 6: 
1. Create a `dictionary` `ages` = ["Alice": 30, "Bob": 25, "Charlie": 35].
2. Use a for loop to print each `name` and `age`.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!

### Task 7: 
1. Write a function called `addNumbers` that takes two integers as `parameters` and returns their `sum`.
2. Call the `function` with values 3 and 7 and print the result.

Make sure to stage your answer and commit it to Github!


## Done?
1. Before logging and saving your changes remotely, you need to specify the changed files you want to save:
   1. To save *all* files in the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   2. To save a specific file/folder from the directory you're in, perform the following command.
   ```bash
   git add {path to file, exclude the brackets}
   ```
3. While in the same directory, make sure you've logged/committed your changes with the following command.
```bash
git commit -m "{describe what changes you made to the file here}"
```
3. If the previous step was already complete, save your changes to the remote repository as follows.
```abash
git push
```
